# Predictive_Modeling [Models: Logistic Regression/ Decision Tree/ Random Forest/ Gradient Boosting]

Project Title:
Nashville Housing Price Prediction

Author:
Rahul Agarwal

Project Description:
This project aims to assist real estate companies in making informed investment decisions by analyzing a housing dataset from the Nashville area. The objective is to build predictive models that can identify overvalued and undervalued properties based on various features. The key variable of interest is "Sale Price Compared To Value," and the project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development and evaluation of multiple predictive models.

Features:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant variables, and addressing outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and relationships in the data.
Model Building: Developing logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models.
Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Usage:
This project provides a comprehensive guide for analyzing a real estate dataset and developing predictive models. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis on your dataset.

Models Developed:
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Decision Tree Model
3. Random Forest Model
4. Gradient Boosting Model
